    "description": "Validates automated incident response workflow for unauthorized EC2 instance launch with ECS registration. Tests Step Functions orchestration, Lambda-based remediation, forensic data capture, quarantine security group application, and instance termination. Simulates attack steps: (1) Create user data script for ECS cluster registration, (2) Launch malicious EC2 instance with ECS configuration. Verifies reactive safeguards execute within MTTR targets and preserve forensic evidence.",
